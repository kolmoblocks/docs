Huawei Canada | Software Engineers | Waterloo, Ontario, Canada | ONSITE | FULL-TIME/ INTERN

Huawei is kickstarting a team to build the tech stack that will power the next generation of the internet. Our goal is to identify and foster dirupting and revolutionary technologies in network protocols and blockchain/Merkle DAG things.   

In the spirit of Bell Labs in its best years, we will focus on pursuits that may pay off only in longer term. We are offering the best of the both worlds: creative freedom of academic research/a startup and the capacity to turn a proof-of-concept into a product capable of seeing mainstream adoption.

Most of our work will be open source. Here are some of the open source projects we are contributing to (that hopefully shows the scope of our interests):
- webassembly.org
- kolmoblocks.org
- github.com/ipfs
- github.com/libp2p

What we offer:
* compensation levels at the top quartile of the market & benefits
* creative freedom to work on your own proposals, and to turn them into fully funded company's projects (if the team sees it as promising)
* most of our work is open source 
* intellectually challenging and creative work at the cutting edge of computer science, not another CRUD app 

Things we appreciate in the applicants (the list is ||, not &&):
* folks with the history of open source contributions
* a background in distributed systems, compilers or video codecs
* background in adjacent academic careers in STEM such as math, physics etc 
* Please mention potatoes in your response to indicate that you have read the position's description
