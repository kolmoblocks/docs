a data block serialization format for content- addressable network protocols based on cryptohash naming scheme. Kolmoblocks can be thought of as scripts for a Turing-complete DSL that take other Merkle data blocks as an input and out- put the target data block. Its design assures block composability, deterministic reproducibility and eliminates the problem of serialization format versioning hell.
