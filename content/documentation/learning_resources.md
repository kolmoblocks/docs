The list of (external) learning materials that people have found useful to learn more about the relevant technologies, to understand the kolmoblocks project, motivation and the context behind it, as well as its positioning within the industry.

## Relevant information theory concepts
- ["Kolmogorov Complexity and Our Search for Meaning" by Noson S. Yanofsky](http://nautil.us/issue/63/horizons/kolmogorov-complexity-and-our-search-for-meaning) - a phylosophical take at the interpretation of the concept of Kolmogorov complexity
- [ExplainXKCD #1155: Kolmogorov Directions](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1155:_Kolmogorov_Directions) - an XKCD comic that can serve as a good illustration of what Kolmogorov complexity is  

## VM (Virtual Machine) concepts
- [skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/] - a tutorial where you build the NES chip's (6502) VM, serves as a great intro into VMs in general
- ["Writing an Interpreter in Go" and "Writing a Compiler in Go" by Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/#books) - amazing two books, perfect to actually get your hands dirty and build up an intuition around implementing compilers and VMs

## Distributed Systems
- ["Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann](https://dataintensive.net/) - this O'Reilly book is an excellent overview of the best practices for building scalable distributed systems 

## Network protocols
- [Udacity's "Computer Networking" course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud436) - is a perfect introduction into the basics behind the tech stack that makes the internet possible


## Webassembly
- [rsms.me/wasm-intro](https://rsms.me/wasm-intro) - different from other hands-on intros to webasm in that it introduces the breakdown/"anatomy" of a wasm module right away (things like type section, import section and so on).  
- [Webassembly's Future](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/webassemblys-post-mvp-future/) - an overview blogpost on the roadmap for the subsequent direction of Webassembly project outside of the MVP version.
